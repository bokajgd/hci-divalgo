<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This project contains the exam for the course Human Computer Interaction.

## Abstract
An interactive tool for diagnoising and evaluating machine learning algorithms.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

For running the scripts, we recommend following the below steps in your bash-terminal. 

### Cloning repository and creating virtual environment

The below code will clone the repository.

__MAC/LINUX/WORKER02__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bokajgd/hci-divalgo.git
cd data-science-exam
```
__WINDOWS:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bokajgd/hci-divalgo.git
cd data-science-exam
```

### Virtual environment

As the code runs on a number of dependencies that may be prone to changes, please use the included file  ```requirements.txt``` to setup a virtual environment.

After cloning the repo, creating the virtual environment you should be ready to go.

<!-- REPOSITORY STRUCTURE -->
## Repository structure

This repository has the following structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```divalgo/``` | Directory containing the streamlit app and visualization tools
```vis/``` | Directory containing all visualizations
```demo.ipynb``` | Notebook demonstrating how to use the divalgo algorithm
```requirements.txt``` | A list of the required packages.
```README.md``` | This v list of the files that git should ignore upon push/pulling (eery README file.
